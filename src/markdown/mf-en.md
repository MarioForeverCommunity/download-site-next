<div class="foot-note" style="font-size:12px">

1. There is no portable archive for v1.16.1, as this version installs its assets in the Windows directory. There is no installer for v7.02_30.
2. The installer for v3.50 is a Chinese repack. This version contains a bug in World 4-2 that prevents from progressing through the game, which was fixed in v3.51.
3. v5.011/v5.013 are identical to v5.01, and v5.08b is identical to v5.08. 
4. The version numbers v5.9s and v5.9r were designated for clarity. The v5.9r executable was last modified on 2013-01-18, while the installer [appears to have been released on 2014-06-26](https://archive.marioforever.net/post/3258680750.html). This version is known to be non-functional.
5. Since v6.0, the official version numbering has been somewhat confusing. The numbers v6.0, v6.01, v6.1, and v6.11 were designated for clarity.
6. The files for v6.1/v6.11 originate from the Super Mario Forever 2016 Pack released by Softendo.
7. The installer of v7.02e is originally named `super-mario-forever-v702e.exe`. The installed v7.02e includes a file called `MarioForever 7.02 Beta.exe`, last modified on 2019-01-28. This file is not the actual game executable, as it's only a launcher that opens a window titled "Softendo Games Steam." The v7.02e game executable is identical to that of v7.02_31 Beta. 
8. The release date of Advance v4.4 (2011) refers to the modification date of the game executable.
9. Portable version removes all icons, URL shortcuts, uninstallers and adware.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Is Mario Forever safe? I've heard it contains a virus.**  
**A:** Many people still believe that Mario Forever is some kind of "malware-infested game," but the truth is more nuanced: the game itself does **not** include any traditional virus. In certain versions, the installer comes with an Internet Explorer advertising add-on called "Mario Forever Toolbar." This add-on is unpopular and intrusive, but it is classified as adware rather than a virus.  
That said, there is a legitimate security concern raised by researchers. According to [Cyble](https://cyble.com/blog/trojanized-super-mario-game-installer-spreads-supremebot-malware/), a particular installer for *super-mario-forever-v702e* was trojanized, bundling malicious components: an XMR miner, a SupremeBot mining client, and an open-source Umbral stealer. This is likely one of the origins of the widespread "MF contains a virus" rumor.  
**Important note:** None of the versions offered on this site contain any of those malicious payloads identified by Cyble. We've verified that installers on this site are safe. Some versions' installers do bundle the "Mario Forever Toolbar," but you can opt not to install it during setup.  
To ease any remaining concerns, we provide a portable version of the game. This version has no bundled toolbar and no irrelevant contents. You may alternatively choose to play one of the fan-made recreated versions, such as Mario Forever Remake or Mario Forever: Community Edition, which are also malware-free.
