This catalog aims at collecting Mario Forever fangames for players to easily find their games to download. 

If you find a game missing and know its information, or find dead links, please [open an issue](https://github.com/MarioForeverCommunity/download-site-next/issues/new/choose) or [report to maintainer via DM](discord://-/users/406048815460646912).

**This catalog is not for game recommendation.**

Due to the goal of this catalog, we don't set any quality bar on games that appear on the list. A removal of certain game only occurs when:

- The creator requests to remove their game from the list.
- The game violates other creators' rights, e.g., the game is made based on a decompiled version of other games.
- The game contains virus and may harm others' devices.
- The game contains topics that are not appropriate to be published on open Internet.

Some old versions of fangames are available on [file.marioforever.net](https://file.marioforever.net/mario-forever/games/). If the game's author wishes to remove them, please send a request.
